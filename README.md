# Timoneiro

An ultra-fast TUI client for Kubernetes, built with Go and Bubble Tea.

"Timoneiro" means helmsman ("Kubernetes") in Portuguese.

## Prototypes / Proofs of Concept

1. Fetch kubernetes resources in a very fast and efficient way, explore the
   usage of informers and build caching for the most common resources
   and search types.

2. Explore the usage of Bubble Tea to build a TUI client that is
   fast and efficient, trying an immediate mode UI approach.

Prototypes are simple executables created in the cmd folder.
