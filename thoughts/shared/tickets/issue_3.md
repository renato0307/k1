# Summary

We need to support more API resources in K1 to cover common Kubernetes
extensions and use cases. We should support the most important ones,
leaving out rarely used or niche resources.

# Acceptance criteria

- Support tier 1, tier 2 and tier 3 resources
- Include a new screen (:system-resources) listing all supported API
  resources with counts, memory usage (even if aprox) and updates since 
  the app started
