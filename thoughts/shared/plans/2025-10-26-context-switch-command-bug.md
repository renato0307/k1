# Context Switch Command Bug Fix - Implementation Plan

## Overview

After a context switch, commands that use kubectl subprocess execution (YAML,
describe, delete, scale, restart, cordon, drain, endpoints, logs, port-forward,
shell) fail because they execute against the WRONG Kubernetes context. The bug
is caused by command closures capturing repository references at command
registry creation time, instead of using the current active repository at
execution time.

## Current State Analysis

### Root Cause

**Command Registry Singleton Pattern:**
- Command registry is created ONCE when `commandbar.New(pool, theme)` is called
  during application startup (`app.go:113`)
- Registry creation calls `pool.GetActiveRepository()` ONCE to get the initial
  active repository (`registry.go:27`)
- This repository reference is captured in ALL command closures at creation
  time (e.g., `YamlCommand(repo)`, `ScaleCommand(repo)`)
- After context switch, command bar is NOT recreated, so commands still hold
  references to the OLD repository

**Context Switch Flow:**
1. User switches context (via contexts screen or `:context` command)
2. Pool updates `p.active` to point to new context's repository
3. App correctly recreates screen registry with new repository (`app.go:447,
   488`)
4. **BUG**: App does NOT recreate command bar, so command registry still has
   old repository

**Impact on Commands:**
- Commands call `repo.GetContext()` and `repo.GetKubeconfig()` to build kubectl
  commands
- These methods return the context name stored in the captured repository
- If captured repository is context-a, `GetContext()` always returns
  "context-a"
- kubectl executes with `--context context-a` even when viewing context-b data

### Key Discoveries

**Files with affected patterns:**

1. **Commands using NewKubectlExecutor (8 commands):**
   - `deployment.go:49` - ScaleCommand
   - `deployment.go:92` - RestartCommand
   - `node.go:36` - CordonCommand
   - `node.go:83` - DrainCommand
   - `service.go:35` - EndpointsCommand
   - `resource.go:145` - DeleteCommand

2. **Commands building kubectl manually (3 commands):**
   - `pod.go:63-69` - LogsCommand
   - `pod.go:130-136` - PortForwardCommand
   - `pod.go:191-197` - ShellCommand

3. **Commands calling repository methods (2 commands):**
   - `resource.go:54` - YamlCommand (calls `repo.GetResourceYAML()`)
   - `resource.go:98` - DescribeCommand (calls `repo.DescribeResource()`)

**Total affected commands: 13**

**Note:** YamlCommand and DescribeCommand delegate to repository methods which
use the repository's stored clientset. These clientsets are bound to specific
contexts at creation time, so they also fail after context switch.

## What We're NOT Doing

- NOT changing the RepositoryPool architecture (it's correct)
- NOT modifying how repositories store context (immutable design is correct)
- NOT changing how screens are re-initialized (already working correctly)
- NOT adding context parameters to every method (violates encapsulation)

## Implementation Approach

**Strategy:** Make command registry query the pool for the active repository at
EXECUTION time instead of capturing repository at CREATION time.

**Key insight:** RepositoryPool's `GetActiveRepository()` method ALWAYS returns
the correct current repository because it reads from `pool.repos[pool.active]`
on every call. We just need commands to call it at the right time.

**Three possible solutions:**

1. **Recreate command bar on context switch** (like screens)
   - Pro: Minimal code changes, mirrors screen pattern
   - Pro: Clean separation - new context = new command bar
   - Con: Recreates entire command bar infrastructure
   - Con: Loses command history on context switch

2. **Store pool reference in commands, call GetActiveRepository() at execution**
   - Pro: Commands always use correct repository
   - Pro: Preserves command history across switches
   - Con: Changes command signatures (repo â†’ pool)
   - Con: Requires updating all 13 affected commands

3. **Add UpdateRegistry() method to CommandBar**
   - Pro: Preserves command bar state (history, UI state)
   - Pro: Only recreates registry (lighter weight)
   - Con: Adds complexity to CommandBar lifecycle
   - Con: Still requires updating all command signatures

**Recommended solution: Option 2** - Store pool reference in commands

Rationale:
- Most correct design - commands get current repository at execution time
- Aligns with Go idiom of "what you need, when you need it"
- Command history preservation is valuable for user workflow
- One-time cost to update command signatures, then maintainable

## Phase 1: Update Command Signatures

  }
  executor := NewKubectlExecutor(repo.GetKubeconfig(), repo.GetContext())

### Success Criteria

#### Automated Verification:
- [x] All affected command files compile without errors: `go build ./...`
- [x] All unit tests pass: `make test`
- [x] Type checking passes: `go vet ./...`
- [ ] No linting errors: `golangci-lint run` (if configured)

#### Manual Verification:
- [x] Start app with context-a loaded
- [x] View a pod in context-a
- [x] Execute `/yaml` command - should show context-a pod YAML
- [x] Execute `/describe` command - should show context-a pod details
- [x] Switch to context-b via contexts screen
- [x] View a pod in context-b (different pod name)
- [x] Execute `/yaml` command - should show context-b pod YAML (not context-a)
- [x] Execute `/describe` command - should show context-b pod details (not
  context-a)
- [x] Test all other affected commands (scale, delete, logs, etc.) work in
  new context
- [x] Verify no errors in terminal output

**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase and all automated
verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation from the human that
manual testing was successful before proceeding to the next phase (if any).

verification passes, pause here for manual confirmation from the human that
manual testing was successful.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

**Command Factory Tests:**
- Test that commands call GetActiveRepository() at execution time
- Test that commands handle nil repository gracefully
- Test that commands use correct context from active repository

**Integration Tests:**
- Test context switch followed by command execution
- Test multiple context switches with interleaved command executions
- Test command history preservation across context switches

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Initial Context Testing:**
   - Start app with default context
   - Execute all affected commands on a test resource
   - Verify commands work correctly

2. **Context Switch Testing:**
   - Switch to different context with different resources
   - Execute same commands on new context's resources
   - Verify commands operate on NEW context (not old)

3. **Multiple Switch Testing:**
   - Switch between 3+ contexts multiple times
   - Execute commands after each switch
   - Verify commands always use current context

4. **Edge Case Testing:**
   - Switch to context that failed to load
   - Verify commands show appropriate error messages
   - Switch back to working context
   - Verify commands work again

5. **Command History Testing:**
   - Execute several commands in context-a
   - Switch to context-b
   - Use up/down arrows to navigate history
   - Verify history is preserved
   - Execute historical command
   - Verify it runs in NEW context (context-b)

## Performance Considerations

**Pool GetActiveRepository() Call Overhead:**
- O(1) operation - map lookup with mutex lock
- Negligible overhead (nanoseconds)
- Called once per command execution (not in hot loop)

**No Performance Impact:**
- Commands already call repository methods which acquire locks
- Additional pool call is minimal compared to kubectl subprocess overhead
- No change to informer cache performance

## Migration Notes

**Backward Compatibility:**
- This is a bug fix, not a feature change
- No API changes visible to users
- No configuration changes required
- Existing kubeconfigs continue to work

**Deployment:**
- Single binary replacement
- No database migrations
- No data loss risk
- Safe to rollback by reverting binary
